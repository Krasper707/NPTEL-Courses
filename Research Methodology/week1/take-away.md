## My takeways
 - Research is not as easy as I previously thought.
 - It requires creativity and a lot of zeal, A LOT.
 - Its not for all ; need grit and need to persevere.
 - Need to take feedback a lot.
 - Its not rigid, a lot of flexibility exists but with appropriate level of difficulty as well.
