## Week 3 notes


### What is data analysis
- Extracting useful,relevant , meaningful observations from observations in systematic manner
- For the purposes of:
  - Parameter estimation
  - Model development and Prediction
  - Feature extraction and classification
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Fault Detection


### Types of analyses
1) Exploratory vs Confirmatory
2) Quantitative vs Qualitative
3) Descriptive vs Inferential
4) Predictive vs Prescriptive, etc

### Types of data

- Several classifications (e.g numerical vs categorical, steady-state vs dynamic, etc) exist. The primary distinction is w.r.t the data generating process(DGP) of mechanism;
- - Deterministic (non-random) and Stochastic (non-deterministic) data

  Deterministic: The DGP is perfectly known OR a mathematical function can perfectly explain the data or there is no uncertainity in the observed values OR process is accurately predictable.
  Stochastic: Observations are only a subset of many possibilities OR no mathematical function can explain the observed data or observations have uncertainities in them. Stochasticity does NOT necessarily mean zero predictability.

#### Why is this important?
- The theory, tools for analysis and interpretations of the results heavily depend on the assumptions of determinism or otherwise.


Population and Sample:
Population refers to collection of all events or possibilities, typically also known as the ensemble. Sample refers to the subset of population that has been obtained through sampling.

Truth and Estimate:
True value refers to the population characteristics in descriptive statistics  or to that of true parameters/signals in parameter/signal estimation

Statistic and estimator:
A statistic is a mathematical function of given observations.


Ensemble average: Average of whole population (aka Expectation)
Bias: Systematic error in an estimate of $\hat\theta$ introduced by virtue of estimation method.

Almost all data analysis procedures are iterative ; not necessarily sequential.

Anscombe's quartet is a group of datasets (x, y) that have the same mean, standard deviation, and regression line, but which are qualitatively different
